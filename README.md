# CollectedNotes AE (Android Edition) 
(Like Titan AE, but, ... yoyu get the point)

## Acknowledgments
Let's get something clear: **[Collected Notes](https://twitter.com/collected_notes)** is [@esacrosa](https://twitter.com/esacrosa)'s creation. This is only an Android client for it.

## Disclaimer
As usual, I set up some conditions just to make this harder to achieve. I decided to use Kotlin (for the first time) and also I am not an Android developer per se. I ocassionally work on Android projects mostly maintenance, and with particular frameworks... but a challence is a challenge.
I was bored, so I started a Flutter version too!

## What I want to build, and how
* v0: Basic functionality.
  * User can enter email/key. Stored and validated
  * User can see profile
  * User can list sites
    * User can see site metadata
    * User can list notes within a site
      * User can see note metadata
      * User can see note contents, with MarkDown language highlighting
      * User can edit and save an existing note, with MarkDown language highlighting
      * User can preview rendered markdown in textview (will not include images or embedded links)
  * Minimal error handling
* v1:
  * User can add new notes
  * User can preview rendered markdown in webview, including images and embedded links
* v2:
  * User can share text intents to the app, creating a new note
 
## Why this project?
I am open to suggestions, changes, etc. I took upon this project for curiosity and fun. I would hate to have multiple clients doing the same basic things, but if you prefer to do your own project, please do!
